Create your first Yeoman web app. Make sure you use the Yeoman Gulp generator.

Create a NEW repo on Github that you will push to
Move your Surf and Paddle into this new repo (leave the old one alone unless you still need to finish it)
Even though you won't be using it. I want to you to install the jQuery plugin "hoverintent" into your project and link it properly from your surf and paddle page. Hint: You will use bower for this. This is just to show you understand how to use Bower and how it relates to your project.
Push this up to Github and and make sure to create the subtree that points to Github Pages (link below)

Also, create another JS file in your JS homework repo from last night and I want you do do the following in it.

Preform some simple operations with numbers
Preform some simple conditional statements using "if" and "else" and make sure to use variables
Create 10 different objects whose properties have a mix of the following value types (you must use each one at least once)
                -  Number
                -  String
                -  Array
                -  Function
                -  Object

Make sure for all of your JS homework you are commenting what you are doing. I should be able to read it and learn about what you were thinking and why. Please have some fun with this, don't create arbitrary words but create something meaningful... like a person object or an animal object etc.
